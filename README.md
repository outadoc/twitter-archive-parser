# Twitter Archive Parser
This project makes it possible to import all the information you own on Twitter in an SQLite database.

## Status
Currently, this tool is only able to make a database out of your Twitter archive, not exploit it.

## Requirements
- An archive containing your info on Twitter; you have to request this by email, but only if you are a citizen of the European Union. Without this archive, this project can't do anything.
- A web server installed on your machine (Apache + PHP)

## How to use
1. Copy the files of this project to your web server (any subdirectory /should/ work)
2. Access http://your-server.foo/path/to/the/tool/install/ from your browser
3. Follow the instructions :)
